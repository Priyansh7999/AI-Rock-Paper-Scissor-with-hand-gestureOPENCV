# Introduction

AI Rock Paper Scissor with hand gesture is an AI-based Python project that enables users to play the classic Rock Paper Scissor game using hand gestures. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect hand and finger movements, allowing users to make rock, paper, or scissor signs with their fingers.

The project uses OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to capture and process video frames from a webcam. It then applies machine learning algorithms to analyze the finger coordinates and determine the hand gesture. The AI opponent generates a random choice (rock, paper, or scissor) and compares it with the user's hand gesture to determine the winner.

To start the game, users simply need to press the 's' key on their keyboard. The game continues until the user decides to quit. The project keeps track of the scores, displaying the number of wins, losses, and draws for both the user and the AI opponent.

This project is an innovative way to interact with AI, promoting a fun and engaging gaming experience. It also demonstrates the potential of computer vision and machine learning in enabling humans to interact with machines using natural gestures.

Key features of the project include:

Hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and machine learning algorithms
Real-time video processing and analysis
AI-generated random choices for a fair game
Scorekeeping and display
User-friendly interface using keyboard input
Overall, AI Rock Paper Scissor with hand gesture is an exciting project that showcases the possibilities of AI-powered gaming and human-computer interaction.
